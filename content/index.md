Lisa Brzozowski fell in love with ceramics at Skidmore College where she
earned a BS in studio art. The marriage between art and utility drew her to
pottery. While developing her skills in the functional arts, she apprenticed
with some of the best production potters in Massachusetts, Virginia and
New York. She has traveled internationally, paying particular attention to
pottery in different cultures. She was particularly influenced by her travels
in Japan, which she references in her current work of candle lanterns.
In 2004 she and her husband started a Pottery and Gallery, Scenic Outlook
Studios, Inc. on the Hudson River in Riparius, NY. Along with her own
pottery, she sold the work of 35 local and regional artists working in a wide
variety of mediums. This allowed her a close and personal experience with
other artistsâ€™ work as well as a better understanding of how the public views
and uses art.

The lessons she learned while running the gallery still informs her work.
Currently, Lisa has turned from production pottery to making one-of-a-kind
artistic expressions. She and her husband Ken live and work in an old
warehouse building on the banks of the Hudson River while frequently
spending time in Manhattan continuing their interactions with other artists
and absorbing some of the great amount of art New York City has to offer.
